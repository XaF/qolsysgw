Qolsys Gateway (`qolsysgw`) is an [AppDaemon][appdaemon]
automation that serves as a gateway between a Qolsys IQ Panel
([2][qolsys-panel-2], [2+][qolsys-panel-2-plus] or [4][qolsys-panel-4])
and [Home Assistant][hass]. Qolsys Gateway works by establishing a connection
to your Qolsys Panel and uses the [MQTT integration of Home Assistant][hass-mqtt].
It takes advantages of the [MQTT discovery][hass-mqtt-discovery]
feature (automatically enabled when you setup the integration) to declare the
device, alarm control panels (for each partition) and different sensors, and
keep them up to date with the information coming from the panel, while
providing you with the means to arm, disarm or trigger your alarm directly
from Home Assistant, manually or through automations.

{% if not installed -%}
## Requirements

- A Qolsys IQ Panel 2 or 2+ (software version 2.5.3 or greater), or 4
  (software version 4.1 or greater),
  for which you have the **dealer code** (defaults to `2222`). In some cases,
  the _installer code_ (defaults to `1111`) might be sufficient, but in my
  experience, it was not, as the required menus were not visible.

- Understanding that this automation is not part of the core of Home Assistant
  and is thus not officially supported by Home Assistant. By using it, you
  agree that neither Home Assistant nor myself are responsible for any issues
  with your Home Assistant configuration, loss of data, or whatever could be
  caused by using Qolsys Gateway. Setting up Qolsys Gateway requires enabling
  the Control4 protocol on your Qolsys Panel, which may open to security issues
  and someone taking over control of your alarm system, so please be aware of
  what you are doing, and only do it if you are ready to take those risks.

## Installation

You can refer to the [README](https://github.com/XaF/qolsysgw#readme) for the details of [how to install](https://github.com/XaF/qolsysgw#installation) and [how to configure](https://github.com/XaF/qolsysgw#configuration) `qolsysgw` and the different components of the process (Home Assistant, AppDaemon, MQTT and the Qolsys Panel).
